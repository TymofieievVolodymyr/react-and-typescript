Let's start with the following example:

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

type TextProps = {
  children: string;
  truncate?: boolean;
  expanded?: boolean;
};

const exampleText =
  "When I was born, the name for what I was did not exist. They called me nymph, assuming I would be like my mother and aunts and thousand cousins. Least of the lesser goddesses, our powers were so modest they could scarcely ensure our eternities. We spoke to fish and nurtured flowers, coaxed drops from the clouds or salt from the waves. That word, nymph, paced out the length and breadth of our futures.";

const truncateString = (string: string, length = 100) =>
  string.slice(0, length) + "â€¦";

function Text({ children, truncate = false, expanded = false }: TextProps) {
  const shouldTruncate = truncate && !expanded;
  return (
    <div aria-expanded={!!expanded}>
      {shouldTruncate ? truncateString(children) : children}
    </div>
  );
}

const Application = () => {
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);
  return (
    <main>
      <Text truncate expanded={expanded}>
        {exampleText}
      </Text>
      <section style={{ marginTop: "1em" }}>
        <button onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}>
          {expanded ? "Contract" : "Expand"}
        </button>
      </section>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Application;
```

Now, let's say that we want to make it so that you can't pass in `expanded` unless `truncate` is also passed in.

How would we do that?

We're going to create three combinations:

- The common, shared props
- A version where we pass in a `truncate` prop.
- A version where we pass in a `truncate` and an optional `expanded` prop.

What we're missing here is a version of the type that has `expanded` without `truncate` .

```tsx
type TextProps = {
  children: string;
};

type NoTruncateTextProps = TextProps & { truncate?: false };
type TruncateTextProps = TextProps & { truncate: true; expanded?: boolean };
```

Now, we can use function overloads to get what we're looking for.

```tsx
function Text(props: NoTruncateTextProps): JSX.Element;
function Text(props: TruncateTextProps): JSX.Element;
function Text(props: TextProps & { truncate?: boolean; expanded?: boolean }) {
  const { children, truncate, expanded } = props;
  const shouldTruncate = truncate && !expanded;
  return (
    <div aria-expanded={!!expanded}>
      {shouldTruncate ? truncateString(children) : children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Mirroring to an HTML Element

There are some more problems with this component. It wraps a `div` and gives us this ability to truncate the text, but we still don't have the ability to do anything with that `div` .

We _could_ do something like this:

```tsx
type TextProps = {
  children: string;
  otherProps?: any;
};
```

And then pass those through to the `div` like so:

```tsx
function Text(props: NoTruncateTextProps): JSX.Element;
function Text(props: TruncateTextProps): JSX.Element;
function Text(props: TextProps & { truncate?: boolean; expanded?: boolean }) {
  const { children, truncate, expanded, otherProps } = props; // ðŸ‘ˆ
  const shouldTruncate = truncate && !expanded;
  return (
    <div aria-expanded={!!expanded} {...otherProps}>
      {" "}
      // ðŸ‘ˆ
      {shouldTruncate ? truncateString(children) : children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

And then take it for a spin:

// TODO

But, we can do better. We can say that our `Text` component takes our special overides and expects a string as a child, but also takes whatever a `div` takes. Either of these will work.

```tsx
interface TextProps extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div"> {
  children: string;
}

type TextProps = {
  children: string;
} & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">;
```

We can now do something like thisâ€¦

```tsx
<Text truncate expanded={expanded} id="Text" style={{ color: "red" }}>
  {exampleText}
</Text>
```

This is what it looks like at the end.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { useState } from "react";

type TextProps = {
  children: string;
} & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">;

type NoTruncateTextProps = TextProps & { truncate?: false };
type TruncateTextProps = TextProps & { truncate: true; expanded?: boolean };

const exampleText =
  "When I was born, the name for what I was did not exist. They called me nymph, assuming I would be like my mother and aunts and thousand cousins. Least of the lesser goddesses, our powers were so modest they could scarcely ensure our eternities. We spoke to fish and nurtured flowers, coaxed drops from the clouds or salt from the waves. That word, nymph, paced out the length and breadth of our futures.";

const truncateString = (string: string, length = 100) =>
  string.slice(0, length) + "â€¦";

function Text(props: NoTruncateTextProps): JSX.Element;
function Text(props: TruncateTextProps): JSX.Element;
function Text(props: TextProps & { truncate?: boolean; expanded?: boolean }) {
  const { children, truncate, expanded, ...otherProps } = props;
  const shouldTruncate = truncate && !expanded;
  return (
    <div aria-expanded={!!expanded} {...otherProps}>
      {shouldTruncate ? truncateString(children) : children}
    </div>
  );
}

const Application = () => {
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);
  return (
    <main>
      <Text truncate expanded={expanded} id="Text" style={{ color: "red" }}>
        {exampleText}
      </Text>
      <section style={{ marginTop: "1em" }}>
        <button onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}>
          {expanded ? "Contract" : "Expand"}
        </button>
      </section>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Application;
```

## Polymorphic Components

So, let's start with a simplifed version of what we had before.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

type TextProps = {
  children: string;
} & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">;

const exampleText =
  "When I was born, the name for what I was did not exist. They called me nymph, assuming I would be like my mother and aunts and thousand cousins. Least of the lesser goddesses, our powers were so modest they could scarcely ensure our eternities. We spoke to fish and nurtured flowers, coaxed drops from the clouds or salt from the waves. That word, nymph, paced out the length and breadth of our futures.";

function Text({ children, ...rest }: TextProps) {
  return <div {...rest}>{children}</div>;
}

const Application = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <Text id="main">{exampleText}</Text>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Application;
```

Right now, `div` is hard coded and so we can assume it takes the same props as `div` and then pass them through.

But, what about if we wanted to be able to swap out the underlying element?

We need to break this problem apart into two pieces.

- The properties of `Text` component itself.
- The passthrough properties.

The `Text` component has the following props:

```tsx
type TextOwnProps<E extends React.ElementType = React.ElementType> = {
  children: string;
  as?: E;
};
```

And we want out custom component to proxy all of its props to the HTML Element minus our special sauce.

```tsx
type TextProps<E extends React.ElementType> = TextOwnProps<E> &
  Omit<React.ComponentProps<E>, keyof TextOwnProps>;
```

We're using `Omit` as a helper in this case.

Finally, we'll refactor our `Text` component as follows:

```tsx
function Text<E extends React.ElementType = typeof defaultElement>({
  children,
  as,
  ...rest
}: TextProps<E>) {
  const TagName = as || "div";
  return <TagName {...rest}>{children}</TagName>;
}
```

### Completed Example

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

type TextOwnProps<E extends React.ElementType = React.ElementType> = {
  children: string;
  as?: E;
};

type TextProps<E extends React.ElementType> = TextOwnProps<E> &
  Omit<React.ComponentProps<E>, keyof TextOwnProps>;

const exampleText =
  "When I was born, the name for what I was did not exist. They called me nymph, assuming I would be like my mother and aunts and thousand cousins. Least of the lesser goddesses, our powers were so modest they could scarcely ensure our eternities. We spoke to fish and nurtured flowers, coaxed drops from the clouds or salt from the waves. That word, nymph, paced out the length and breadth of our futures.";

const defaultElement = "div";

function Text<E extends React.ElementType = typeof defaultElement>({
  children,
  as,
  ...rest
}: TextProps<E>) {
  const TagName = as || "div";
  return <TagName {...rest}>{children}</TagName>;
}

const Application = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <Text id="main" as="label" htmlFor="wow">
        {exampleText}
      </Text>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Application;
```
