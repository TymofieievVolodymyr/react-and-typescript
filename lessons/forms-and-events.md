I demonstrated how to add events using a class-based example, can you add some using [a hooks-based example](https://codesandbox.io/s/incident-counter-5rvp3?file=/src/Application.tsx)?

If you want to work locally, you can use `projects/counter-for-hooks` as in the project repository as a starter.

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/incident-counter-5rvp3?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FApplication.tsx&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="incident-counter"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>
